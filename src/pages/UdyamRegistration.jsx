                What is Udyam Registration?
            </h2>
            <p style={{ fontSize: '1.1em', color: '#555', lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
            <strong>Udyam registration</strong> is a government initiative under the Ministry of
                Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) aimed at providing
                businesses, especially micro, small, and medium enterprises, a simple
                and streamlined registration process. It replaced the older <strong>Udyog Aadhaar</strong>
                system in July 2020, making it easier for businesses to register and
                receive the benefits provided by the government for MSMEs.
            </p>
            <p  style={{ fontSize: '1.1em', color: '#555', lineHeight: '1.6', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
                The registration is completely online and paperless, requiring only
                basic information about the business. Once registered, businesses can
                access various incentives, subsidies, and financial support aimed at
                helping MSMEs grow.
